            "Back in the 70's there was a marvelous second-hand store on 13th Street close to MacDonald Avenue in Richmond called Value Village. One day I was shopping there in the upstairs loft area and came upon a filthy canvas covered box. Ill-concealing my contempt, I kicked it and it skittered across the floor. Intrigued, I opened it up and discovered a rattan trunk from the South Pacific and World War II. I stripped off the canvas and revealed what you see in these photos."

Got new tires about 3,000 miles ago. Always has the oil changed on time (due in about 1k). Just got a thorough cleaning inside and a wash and wax outside (still wet in the photos). This truck has never been offroad, but the 4WD is working perfectly from the few times we've been up to Tahoe in it. However, it's a 10+ year old truck that's been driven, not babied and garaged all the time. It's got some scratches, paint is not perfect, but zero body damage."

            "Up for your consideration is this gorgeous brushed titanium frame from Denver Colorado's own Sampson Sports that's from 1998. It's a rare one, from the days when company founder Eric Sampson was only putting out a small quantity of frames and parts. Today, has a much expanded lineup, including ultra high-end components of almost every sort from frames to bottom brackets to derailleurs. Why own a mass produced Litespeed or Merlin Ti ride, when you can have a super small batch frame made in the Rockies? COMPLETE bike is in\u00a0Excellent shape! \u00a0The frame is straight, with NO cracks, bends, dents, etc.\u00a0The finish is overall in great shape, with only a few minor nicks and scratches. I've upgraded the components to more modern Sram Rival 10 speed double group set.",
